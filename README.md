**Description :**
***EGAPPBoxV2*** is an **updated version** for EGAPPBox-CAC. It has *better looking and functionality* than the previous version. The App can now run in both MacOS and Windows ( Ideally Windows 10 ). It will auto detect the OS of the PC and alter the CAC form ( A form which store PC details ) and the format of storing data. The data retrieve from the PC will now store online in MongoDB and can be retrieve from anywhere which allows users to easily access the data and print out as PDF. 
This is created to help Tech Team in ***Computers against Covid Project*** by Engineering Good SG. 
The App will help Tech Team to auto detect computer information like model name and serial number of the PC and print out the result in a form (CAC Form) as a PDF. 
The record saved by the tech team will also be uploaded and saved to Google Sheets so that the person-in-charge in Engineering Good can easily track the location of the laptops and their details.

**Programming Language Used :**
*HTML, CSS, JavaScript and very little of PowerShell*.
This app project is created with [**ElectronJS**](https://www.electronjs.org/).
Functions carried by the app are all in JavaScript. IU design of the app is done by *HTML & CSS*.
This has made the development of a Windows app easier. ( [More Info about modern app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2013/february/modern-apps-create-windows-store-apps-with-html5-and-javascript) )

**Link to Engineering Good Discord Server :**
[**Engineering Good @ Discord**](https://discord.gg/4ctzGu5v4F)
Engineering Good Discord is used to store CAC PDF created by the APP. Everytime the App creates a PDF, the PDF will be automatically sent to The Discord Server through EGAPPBox Discord Bot `(EGAPPBox#1284)`
